# Quick Start Guide for Contributing Bioinformatics Code & Pipelines

Welcome! We encourage AAFC scientists, bioinformaticians, analysts, and developers to contribute bioinformatics code and reproducible pipelines to our growing open-source ecosystem. Here's how to get started:

---

## Requesting a New GitHub Repository

To create a **new repository** under the AAFC GitHub organization:

1. Submit a ticket via the MyITCentreTI application under category: 
   
   `Science IT Support > Science Code Catalogue > Repository Management > Creating private repositories`

   Include the following details in the ticket:
   - GitHub handle of the admin on this repository
   - Email ID of the admin's supervisor 
   - Proposed repository name and a 1-2 line bilingual (EN/FR) description
  
2. The new repository will be created using the [template repository](https://github.com/AAFC-Bioinfo-AAC/template-repository) that includes:
   - A default `README.md` template
   - A default License (MIT) and Crown copyright
   - Other files (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, etc)

3. The admin is responsible for maintaining the repo and may add team members and assign privileges (read/write). The admin may also request adding/removing users or modifying user privileges via a MyITCentreTI ticket in the appropriate category under: 
   
   `Science IT Support > Science Code Catalogue > Account Management`
   
4. The README template may be customised as needed — just ensure the repo remains **reproducible**, with clear metadata, documentation, and usage instructions.

## Publishing a Repository

When your code is ready for public release:

1. Submit a ticket via the MyITCentreTI application under category: 
   
   `Science IT Support > Science Code Catalogue > Repository Management > Reviewing repositories for approval before publication`

   Please ensure that:
   - all steps in the `Approval process for open source code` have been followed and the
   - the associated form and its check list are attached (links provided via the ticket)
   - the appropriate License is included in the repository (consult with your local OIPC officer if in doubt). 

---

## Migrating an Existing Repository

Already have a GitHub repo in a personal or external account?

1. Backup or clone your repo locally.
2. Request a new repository via the process above.
3. Push your local copy into the new repo.

---

## Managing Repository Access

The admin of the repo can add **team members** with specific permissions (e.g., read, write).
**Only AAFC GitHub Organization Owners** can **Create** or **delete** repositories and change organization-wide settings.

If you need a repo deleted/archived/deprecated, please submit a ticket via the MyITCentreTI application in the appropriate category under: 
   
   `Science IT Support > Science Code Catalogue > Repository Management`

## Contributing to Existing Repositories

### Public Repositories
- Open an **issue** to suggest changes, report bugs, or start discussions.
- Fork the repo, submit **pull requests**, and follow the `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidelines.

### Private Repositories
- Refer to the [internal SharePoint list of private repositories](https://001gc.sharepoint.com/sites/42732/asd1/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2F42732%2Fasd1%2FABCC%2FList%20of%20private%20repos%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2F42732%2Fasd1%2FABCC) for repositories of interest.
- Contact the listed owner or maintainer to request access or propose contributions.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors must follow the [Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25049). Be respectful, inclusive, and constructive in all interactions.
