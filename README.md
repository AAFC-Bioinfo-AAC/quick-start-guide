## *AAFC-Bioinfo-AAC* GitHub services

The following services are available via `My IT Centre TI` under category: `Science‚ÄØIT‚ÄØSupport > AAFC Bioinformatics Code Catalogue` ([internal access link](https://aafcaac-dwp.ca.onbmc.com/dwp/rest/share/OJSXG33VOJRWKVDZOBST2U2CL5IVKRKTKREU6TSOIFEVERJGORSW4YLOOREWIPKBI5DUKWKKHA4EUNKUJBBUCU2KJNAVASSTJJFUCUCKJM4TKWRGOJSXG33VOJRWKSLEHU2TANJGMNXW45DFPB2FI6LQMU6UGQKUIFGE6R27JBHU2RI=)).

### 1. Repository Management

#### 1.1. Create a new private repository

To initiate a new project or migrate an existing one to the `AAFC-Bioinfo-AAC` GitHub organization, click **Create a new private repository** and complete the form with:

- A repository name following [AAFC-Bioinfo-AAC repository naming conventions](./docs/repo-naming-style-guide.md).
- A brief bilingual description (English and French)
- Repository admin‚Äôs name, official email, GitHub username, and supervisor‚Äôs email
- If applicable, a list of team members with their names, email, GitHub username and assigned roles (admin, maintain, write, or read; refer [role permissions guide](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization#permissions-for-each-role))

Important Notes:

- At least one user must be assigned the admin role.
- The admin is responsible for ongoing repository maintenance and user management.
- Contributors must follow [coding best practices](./docs/coding-best-practices.md).
- Additional users can be added later by the admin. If a user is not yet part of the organization, use the [Add new user](./README.md#21-add-new-user) form to ensure proper onboarding.

Once approved, the repository will be initialized from the standard template, including:

- Bilingual README templates with guidance and examples
- MIT License with Crown copyright
- Standard documents: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, etc.

 [Add new user](./README.md#21-add-new-user) form, to manage organizational membership consistently.

#### 1.2. Publish a repository

To make a repository public, select **Publish a repository** button and complete the form with the following information:

- Repository name
- Repository admin's name, official email address, GitHub username and supervisor's email address
- Attach a completed **Open-Source Development or Publication Approval Form**, signed by the Associate Director of your centre.

Following a successful security review of the repository and ISB Director approval, the repository will be published.

#### 1.3. Delete/Archive/Deprecate repository

To request the removal or status change (Archive/Deprecate) of a repository, select the **Delete/Archive/Deprecate repository** button and complete the form with the following details:

- Repository name
- Repository admin's name, official email address, GitHub username and supervisor's email address
- Reason for deletion, archival, or deprecation
Preferred action:

Delete: Permanently remove the repository from the organization. This action is irreversible.
Archive: Lock the repository to prevent further changes while preserving its contents for reference.
Deprecate: Mark the repository as deprecated, update the README to reflect its status, and optionally link to a successor repository if applicable.

All requests will be reviewed by the `AAFC-Bioinfo-AAC` admin team. For deletion requests, a confirmation will be sent to the repository admin and supervisor before proceeding. Archival and deprecation actions will be completed following internal review and notification.

### 2. Account Management

- Repository admins can add team members and assign roles themselves
- For access or role changes, submit a ticket via *MyITCentreTI*:

   ```text

   ```

- **Only AAFC GitHub Organization Owners** can create/delete repositories or modify organization-wide settings.

To request repository deletion, archival, or deprecation, submit a *MyITCentreTI* ticket under:
