## Overview

### Requesting a New GitHub Repository

To request a new repository:

1. Submit a ticket via *MyITCentreTI*:

   ```
   Scienceâ€¯ITâ€¯Support > Scienceâ€¯Codeâ€¯Catalogue > Repository Management > Creating private repositories
   ```

2. Include the following:
   - GitHub username of the repository admin
   - Email of the admin's supervisor
   - Proposed repository name (follow [Repository naming style guide](/docs/repo-naming-style-guide.md/))
   - Brief bilingual description (1-2 lines, EN/FR)

A team member will contact the repository admin shortly with a link to the new repository, initialized from the [template repository](https://github.com/AAFC-Bioinfo-AAC/template-repository), which includes:
   - A pre-filled `README.md`
   - An MIT License with Crown copyright
   - Supporting documents (e.g., `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`)

The designated admin is responsible for repository maintenance, ensuring that:
- team members and their roles are properly managed
- repository is easy to reproduce, clearly documented, and simple for others to understand and use.

### Publishing a Repository

To make a repository public:

1. Submit a ticket via *MyITCentreTI*:

   ```
   Scienceâ€¯ITâ€¯Support > Scienceâ€¯Codeâ€¯Catalogue > Repository Management > Reviewing repositories for approval before publication
   ```

2. Ensure:
   - All steps in the Approval Process for Open Source Code have been completed
   - The required form and checklist are attached to the ticket (refer to the ticket page for links to those documents).
   - The license is correctly set (consult OIPC/Commercialization Officer if uncertain).

### Migrating an Existing Repository

To migrate an external GitHub repository into the AAFC organization:

- Clone or back up your existing repository
- Follow the standard request process to create a new repository
- Push your local code to the new repository

---

### Managing Repository Access

- Repository admins can add team members and assign read/write privileges themselves
- For access or privilege changes, submit a ticket via *MyITCentreTI*:

   ```
   Scienceâ€¯ITâ€¯Support > Scienceâ€¯Codeâ€¯Catalogue > Account Management
   ```

- **Only AAFC GitHub Organization Owners** can create/delete repositories or modify organization-wide settings.

To request repository deletion, archival, or deprecation, submit a *MyITCentreTI* ticket under:

   ```
   Scienceâ€¯ITâ€¯Support > Scienceâ€¯Codeâ€¯Catalogue > Repository Management
   ```

### Contributing to Existing Repositories

#### Public Repositories

- Open Github issues to suggest features, report bugs, or initiate discussions.
- Fork the repository, make edits and open a pull request per `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidelines.

#### Private Repositories

- Refer to the [internal list of private repositories](https://001gc.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/42732/SitePages/abcc-private-repos.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=jXxrXb).
