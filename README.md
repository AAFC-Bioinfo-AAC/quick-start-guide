## The ABCC RCBA Code Catalogue
The ABCC RCBA Code Catalogue aims to facilitate the creation and sharing of scientific pipelines and analytic resources amongst Canadian Researchers, based on the *F.A.I.R.* principle: findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. 

### Finding Pipelines in the ABCC
    **TBD**

### How to Contribute  
If you would like to contribute a new pipeline or work on an existing pipeline, more info on how to do so can be found [here](how_to_contribute.md).

### Guidelines
A set of [suggestions](pipeline_guidelines.md) have been put together to help pipeline creators follow *F.A.I.R* guidelines, making analysis tools easy to find, use, and create.
