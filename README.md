## Getting Started

Welcome! We encourage AAFC scientists, bioinformaticians, analysts, and developers to contribute bioinformatics code and reproducible pipelines to our open-source ecosystem. This guide will help you get started with repository creation, contribution, and publication.

---

## Requesting a New GitHub Repository

To create a **new repository** under the AAFC GitHub organization:

1. Submit a ticket via the *MyITCentreTI* application:

   ```
   Science IT Support > Science Code Catalogue > Repository Management > Creating private repositories
   ```

2. Include the following details:
   - GitHub handle of the repository admin
   - Email of the admin's supervisor
   - Proposed repository name following guidelines in the [Repository naming style guide](repo-naming-style-guide.md).
   - Brief bilingual (EN/FR) description of 1-2 lines

3. The repository will be initialized from the [template repository](https://github.com/AAFC-Bioinfo-AAC/template-repository), which includes:
   - A default `README.md`
   - An MIT License with Crown copyright
   - Supporting documents (e.g., `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`)

4. The designated admin is responsible for repository maintenance, including:
   - Managing team members and assigning roles
   - Submitting access or privilege change requests via:

     ```
     Science IT Support > Science Code Catalogue > Account Management
     ```

5. You may customize the README and other files as needed. Ensure your repository is **reproducible**, well-documented, and includes clear usage instructions.

## Publishing a Repository

To make your repository publicly accessible:

1. Submit a *MyITCentreTI* ticket under:

   ```
   Science IT Support > Science Code Catalogue > Repository Management > Reviewing repositories for approval before publication
   ```

2. Ensure:
   - All steps in the Approval Process for Open Source Code have been completed, and the required form and checklist are attached to the ticket (refer to the ticket page for links to those documents).
   - The appropriate license is included (consult your local OIPC/Commercialization Officer if uncertain).

---

## Migrating an Existing Repository

If you already have a GitHub repository outside the organization:

1. Backup or clone your existing repository.
2. Request a new repository via the standard process above.
3. Push your local copy to the newly created repository.

---

## Managing Repository Access

- Repository admins can add team members and assign read/write privileges.
- **Only AAFC GitHub Organization Owners** can create/delete repositories or modify organization-wide settings.

To request repository deletion, archival, or deprecation, submit a *MyITCentreTI* ticket under:

```
Science IT Support > Science Code Catalogue > Repository Management
```

## Contributing to Existing Repositories

### Public Repositories

- Open issues to suggest features, report bugs, or initiate discussions.
- Fork the repository and submit pull requests according to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidelines.

### Private Repositories

- Refer to the [internal list of private repositories](https://001gc.sharepoint.com/sites/42732/asd1/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2F42732%2Fasd1%2FABCC%2FList%20of%20private%20repos%2Epdf).
- Contact the repository owner/maintainer for access or collaboration.
