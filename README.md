## *AAFC-Bioinfo-AAC* GitHub services

The following services are available via `My IT Centre TI` under category: `Science‚ÄØIT‚ÄØSupport > AAFC Bioinformatics Code Catalogue` ([internal access link](https://aafcaac-dwp.ca.onbmc.com/dwp/rest/share/OJSXG33VOJRWKVDZOBST2U2CL5IVKRKTKREU6TSOIFEVERJGORSW4YLOOREWIPKBI5DUKWKKHA4EUNKUJBBUCU2KJNAVASSTJJFUCUCKJM4TKWRGOJSXG33VOJRWKSLEHU2TANJGMNXW45DFPB2FI6LQMU6UGQKUIFGE6R27JBHU2RI=)).

### 1. Repository Management

#### 1.1. Create a new private repository

To request a new repository on *AAFC-Bioinfo-AAC*, either to develop a fresh project or to [migrate an existing repository](./README.md#migrating-an-existing-repository) from another location, select **Create a new private repository** button and complete the form with the following information:

- A repository name that complies with the [AAFC-Bioinfo-AAC repository naming conventions](./docs/repo-naming-style-guide.md).
- A concise description (1-2 lines) of the repository in both English and French.
- Repository admin's name, official email address, GitHub username and supervisor's email address.
- A list of names, email addresses, GitHub usernames and roles (`admin`, `maintain`, `read` or `write`; refer [permissions-for-each-role](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization#permissions-for-each-role)) of any other users to be added to the repository.

Note that at least one user must be assigned the `admin` role. The repository `admin` will be responsible for ongoing maintenance, ensuring that the team members and roles are properly managed. All contributors are expected to apply established [coding best practices](./docs/coding-best-practices.md). Additional users may be added later to the repository directly by the `admin`. However, if a user is not yet part of `AAFC-Bioinfo-AAC`, the recommended method is to use the [Add new user](./README.md#21-add-new-user) form, to manage organizational membership consistently.

The designated repository `admin` will be notified by email of the new private repository, initialized from the `AAFC-Bioinfo-AAC` template repository, with the following content included:

- English and French `README` templates (with instructions for recommended sections and example content).
- A default MIT License with Crown copyright.
- Standard supporting documents (e.g., `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, etc.).

#### 1.2. Publish a repository

To make a repository public, select **Publish a repository** button and complete the form with the following information:

- Repository name
- Repository admin's name, official email address, GitHub username and supervisor's email address
- Attach a completed **Open-Source Development or Publication Approval Form**, signed by the Associate Director of your centre.

Following a successful security review of the repository and ISB Director approval, the repository will be published.

#### 1.3. Delete/Archive/Deprecate repository

To request the removal or status change (Archive/Deprecate) of a repository, select the **Delete/Archive/Deprecate repository** button and complete the form with the following details:

- Repository name
- Repository admin's name, official email address, GitHub username and supervisor's email address
- Reason for deletion, archival, or deprecation
Preferred action:

Delete: Permanently remove the repository from the organization. This action is irreversible.
Archive: Lock the repository to prevent further changes while preserving its contents for reference.
Deprecate: Mark the repository as deprecated, update the README to reflect its status, and optionally link to a successor repository if applicable.

All requests will be reviewed by the `AAFC-Bioinfo-AAC` admin team. For deletion requests, a confirmation will be sent to the repository admin and supervisor before proceeding. Archival and deprecation actions will be completed following internal review and notification.

### 2. Account Management

- Repository admins can add team members and assign roles themselves
- For access or role changes, submit a ticket via *MyITCentreTI*:

   ```text
   Science‚ÄØIT‚ÄØSupport > Science‚ÄØCode‚ÄØCatalogue > Account Management
   ```

- **Only AAFC GitHub Organization Owners** can create/delete repositories or modify organization-wide settings.

To request repository deletion, archival, or deprecation, submit a *MyITCentreTI* ticket under:

   ```text
   Science‚ÄØIT‚ÄØSupport > Science‚ÄØCode‚ÄØCatalogue > Repository Management
   ```

#### 2.1. Add new user

#### 2.2. Remove user

#### 2.3. Modify user privileges
