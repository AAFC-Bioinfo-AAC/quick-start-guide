    - Process for reporting issues?
- Citations document for the tools used (template provided)
- License, copyright, etc.
- Pipeline files
- a conda environment? naming format env_[pipeline name].yml
- 
Guides to create:
- Conda Guide
- Pipeline creation guide
- Useful links
- Guidelines


What we will need to provide:
- readme template
- citations template
- citation.cff template
- changelog template 
- license? suggest
- file structure? suggest, check bioinformatics best practices, can recommend like configs go here, etc. 
- reference genomes? file location suggestion and how to name them, best practice suggestion  
 
  
This README file will indicate how to interact with the template repository to create and submit your own pipeline to the AAFC Code Catalogue? Or it could act as a landing page and link to the different guides and generally explain how to interact with the repo.   

Useful Links:
