# Coding Best Practices — Quick Reference

- **Write clean, readable code** → meaningful names, consistent style, small functions.
- **Document clearly** → keep READMEs, comments, and usage instructions up to date.
- **Test thoroughly** → unit, integration, automated CI/CD, reproducibility.
- **Use version control effectively** → clear commits, branching strategy, peer-reviewed PRs.
- **Handle errors safely** → fail gracefully, no sensitive info in errors/logs.
- **Manage dependencies** → pin versions, update regularly, scan for vulnerabilities.
- **Apply secure coding principles** → validate inputs, protect secrets, least privilege.
- **Keep code maintainable** → modular, reusable, refactor often, design for scalability.
- **Follow repository conventions** → proper naming, standard docs (LICENSE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY).
