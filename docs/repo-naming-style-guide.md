## Overview

### General Naming Conventions

| Rule | Guideline |
|------|-----------|
| **Lowercase** | Use lowercase letters only. Avoid uppercase to maintain consistency across OSes. |
| **Kebab-case** | Use hyphens (`-`) to separate words: e.g., `genome-assembler`, `api-client`. |
| **No spaces** | Never use spaces; they break URLs and CLI tools. |
| **No special characters** | Avoid characters like `@`, `#`, `!`, etc. Stick to letters, numbers, and hyphens. |
| **Keep it short and descriptive** | Aim for clarity, not length: `snp-pipeline` > `a_pipeline_for_snps_on_genomes` |
| **Use keywords** | Include relevant terms for easy searchability (e.g., `alignment-tool`, `rna-seq-qc`). |

### Structural Patterns by Type

#### Research Projects
- `pathogen-genome-assembly`
- `metagenomics-qc`
- `host-microbiome-modeling`

#### Pipelines/Tools
- `rna-seq-pipeline`
- `variant-caller`
- `image-segmentation-model`

#### Utilities / Scripts
- `data-cleaner`
- `metadata-parser`

#### Libraries / APIs
- `python-genomics-api`
- `r-statmodel-utils`

#### Web Interfaces
- `sample-tracking-ui`
- `bioportal-dashboard`

---

### Collaboration & Ownership Prefixes (Optional)

For internal repos or team-based grouping:
- `bioinfo-snp-caller`
- `labtech-dashboard`
- `aafc-data-pipeline`

> ℹ️ Use prefixes sparingly to avoid clutter.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Why to Avoid |
|--------|--------------|
| `CamelCaseNames` | Breaks consistency and can cause issues on case-sensitive systems. |
| `underscored_names` | Hyphens are preferred for readability and URLs. |
| `very-long-and-descriptive-names-that-are-hard-to-remember` | Be clear, but concise. |
| Including file extensions (e.g., `myproject.py`) | Repositories are not files. |

---

### Examples of Good Names

- `genome-visualizer`
- `rna-seq-qc`
- `field-sensor-api`
- `plant-pathogen-models`
- `microbe-tracker-pipeline`
