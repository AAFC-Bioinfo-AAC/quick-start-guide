# Template Repository User Guide

## Notes:

- Using GitHub badges is a great way to display project metadata, build status, license, dependencies, versioning, and more â€” directly in your README.md. Badges can be linked and clickable to point to the information or the services linked to the badge. The badges in the template repo were created using [Shields.io](https://shields.io/). For example, the MIT license badge was created using:

```
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
```

- The Table of Contents (TOC) may be autogenerated, for example, by running command [Create Table of Contents](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one#table-of-contents) in the VSCode extension *Markdown All in One*. The TOC may optionally be placed above the **About** section. To exclude a heading from appearing in the autogenerated TOC, add a comment <!-- omit in toc --> at the end of that heading or just above it and save/update the table.

- The workflow diagram in the template repository was created using [Mermaid Diagramming and charting tool](https://mermaid.js.org/). The Mermaid code can be tested [here](https://www.mermaidchart.com/play).
