# A Short GPSC Guide
> Note:
    You must first have access to the GPSC. To request an account, follow the instructions [here](https://gcxgce.sharepoint.com/teams/1000645/SitePages/GPSC-Guides.aspx?OR=Teams-HL&CT=1708971900190&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiIyNy8yNDAxMDQxNzUwNCIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D#fill-out-account-request-form)  

## What is the GPSC
The [General Purpose Science Cluster (GPSC)](https://portal.science.gc.ca/confluence/) is a High-Performance Computer (HPC) provided by Shared Service Canada (SSC). As a member of the Code Catalogue, you will primarily be working on __, but a [complete list of computing resources](https://portal.science.gc.ca/confluence/display/SCIDOCS/Compute+Resources)) can be found in the SSC guide.

## Connecting to the GPSC


## GPSC Locations
### 1. Interactive containers
Interactive containers have full access to the internet and can be used to download small to moderate amounts of data, install software, and set up a new Conda environments.

### 2. Compute clusters
Compute clusters should mainly be used for analysis. Jobs running on the clusters have limited access to the internet, so itâ€™s best to first download data from an interactive container or landing pad and *then* run your analysis on a compute cluster.

### 3. Landing pads
The landing pad is used to initially connect to the GPSC, before connecting to an interactive container and should not be used for HPC workloads, but can be used to download data before running an analysis..  

If you need to download large amounts of data you can do this on the following landing pad:
